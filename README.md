This is a very basic outline to the game i want to build. I have alot of notes written down in my journal and I may be posting them here.
This game will be text heavy, so I have alot of writing to do alongside learning how to code.
I still have alot to learn but here are the inital tasks that I hope Prime Academy can teach me.
How to create monsters (check)
How to store stats
How to level up
How to battle

How to make a grid based movement system
How to have sections of the grid unacessable

# ericsGame
This is a very basic outline to the game I want to build. I have alot of notes written down in my journal and I may be posting them here.
This game will be text heavy, so I have alot of writing to do alongside learning how to code.

I still have alot to learn but here are the initial tasks that I have to get me started. I have a basic idea about how these would work, but am unsure about implementation at this point.

How to create animals (check)

how to catch them and save them to an account

How to store stats

How to level up

How to battle


How to make a grid based movement system

How to have sections of the grid unacessable
